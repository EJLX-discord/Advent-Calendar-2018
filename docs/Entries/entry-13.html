<h5>My favorite thing</h5>
One of my favorite things is handcrafts.<br/>
I think I like it since when I was a child.<br/>
The oldest thing I made as far as I remember was a embroidered pen case made from felts when I was in 4th grade of elementary school.<br/>
I made it as a birthday present for my mother. <br/>
And I also made baby clothes when my children were small.<br/>
Anyway, I still love to do handcraft, and recently, the most favorite handcraft is a leathercraft.<br/>
Especially, I love to make it with patchworking from a lot of pieces of leather rather than making by a big sheet of leather.<br/>
I usually decide a theme when I make them.<br/>
The theme is come up when I see a piece of leather.<br/>
For example, when I saw a scaly blue leather, I imaged "a little mermaid".<br/>
and then, I looked inside a big basket, which there are a lot of pieces of leather in it, and picked out some leathers that fits the image.<br/>
Furthermore, I searched an internet and found a button of ship at online shop.
And the wallet, which I posted below this essay,  is what I imaged and completed.
the most fun time is when I am imagining from a piece of leather.<br/>
I am looking forward to finding out a new leather which gives me a good inspiration as ever.
