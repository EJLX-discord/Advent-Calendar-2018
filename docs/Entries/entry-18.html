  Hey there, it’s my turn and I am writing about things I like. (I chose the easiest topic for me :D)
</p>

<p>
  First of all, I am so curious that I have wide interests in many genres, for example, Literatures, arts, movies, musics, biology, philosophy and so on. Then I picked up my favourite animals to write. 
</p>

  I love penguins with no kidding. I love the most awkward and the coolest birds. Do you know how many sub-species penguin has? It’s 18,in addition, they are all living in south hemisphere.  I want you to know any any penguin has habitats in north polar. Moreover, the penguins which live in harsh cold places are just half of all penguin’s sub-species. Most of them rather have their habitats in warmer locations, take Africa penguin for instant, they live near Cape town in South Africa, in which average temperature is 16.8℃. Did you know that? 
  In fact, we could not research some of penguins enough to understand their lives like where they hunt fish, so actually they are mysterious 😃
  As a last, I introduce my favourite penguin to you; it’s Chin- strap penguin. Their habitats are placed in Sub-Antarctic Islands. The reason why I love them most is their face. Look for it if you got an interest because that is the best way to have you know about them.

  I hope some will be a fun of these cutest birds 😃 thank you.
