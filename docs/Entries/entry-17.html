  This message is my self introduction in May.<br>
  I wonder how much I'm getting better at speaking English.<br>
  And yes, I chose this theme because I want to study English more and more in 2019! <br>
  So my new year's resolution is "speaking English like a Japanese flight attendant"<br>
  I don't mean I want to be a flight attendant, but don't you think they are really cool and they can speak English fluently?
</p>

<p>
  My old days dream was I wanted to be a Japanese secretary.<br>
  They are so smart and cool... And I guess they can speak English perfectly.<br>
  But unfortunately, I really didn't like studying English when I was a student.<br>
  Because I couldn't understand what my teacher was saying!!<br>
  Present progressive...??? Past perfect...??? Be verbs...!!!???<br>
  Then, I stopped thinking about English.<br>
  I was like,<br>
  "Haha~ we are Japanese, who does care about English? We don't need that"<br>
  But... Yes, I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently working at my office. And there are lots of coworkers here(only seniors in my office though).<br>
  Some seniors can reply E-mail for overseas people!!<br>
  And I ask how is your English skill to one senior. Then she said,<br>
  "Um~. I don't know, but I only have Eiken grade 3"<br>
  I was shocked very much...<br>
  I have that grade, but I can't do that like her...<br>
  Also that grade is for junior high school students!!!!(I got that when I was 15 years old)<br>
  So she learned English herself!<br>
  My sense of rivalry was heating up.<br>
  I want to be cooler than 2018 in 2019!!!!
</p>

<p>
  I only use this server for studying English. If you guys think,<br>
  "Oh, Stella's English is improved! Better than that introduction!"<br>
  Then, because of you guys!<br>
  Keep being nice for English learners!<br>
  I'll do my best for Japanese learners!!<br>
  Thank you for talking with me everyone, every times!<br>
  And thank you for reading! Bye bye~
