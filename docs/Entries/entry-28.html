<h4>Advent Calendar <br> 28th of December 2018</h4>

<h5>An interesting experience I had</h5>

<p>I love meeting people from all over the world and especially get excited when I encounter or experience things I've never expected.</p>

<p>One day, I was chatting to a person from South America on a game server and noticed birds' singing in the background. I asked him whether he had pet birds but was told those songs were from tree frogs. His house was located in the countryside and tree frogs were everywhere outside his house he said.</p>

<p>I was astonished. My father had a pet tree frog before but they are rare in Japan. They only live near very clean streams.</p>

<p>Listening to those frogs' beautiful and magical songs, I started to see the guy's house surrounded with tall green trees in my mind. On the branches, many tree frogs were singing and there was a pure stream running quietly by the trees.
I imagined it was humid there and his place was nothing like my place.
But we were chatting and spending a little time together even his place was across the globe to mine.
</p>

<p>I have a couple of other online friends in the Southern Hemisphere.
I just think it's fascinating that their places are in summer when my place is in winter.
The earth is so big, yet we can talk like we are next to each other and play games together.</p>

<p>I really love hearing things I've never thought or heard of or imagined before.
On this server, so many different perspectives and ways of thinking I see and hear.
I'm really happy I found this server!
People are kind, knowledgeable and really inspiring.
Thank you guys very much for opening my eyes always <3</p>
